# Perfect Pump

Fluids 2.0 opened up many new possibilities. However, one big sore point that remains is that it's very difficult to transfer precise amounts of fluids. The speed of a pump depends on how full the input segment is. This is especially relevent when trying to do sushi pipes, for example for a single-pipe, multi-fluid provider station.

But what if you just had a pump so POWERFUL, so PERFECT, that it just didn't care about something as silly as "pressure"? Well now you can! The Perfect Pump always runs at full speed, no matter how full it's input pipe is. Multi-fluid providers will never be the same again!
