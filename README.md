# Perfect Pump

Fluids 2.0 opened up many new possibilities. However, one big sore point that remains is that it's very difficult to transfer precise amounts of fluids. The speed of a pump depends on how full the input segment is. This is especially relevent when trying to do sushi pipes, for example for a single-pipe, multi-fluid provider station.

But what if you had a pump so POWERFUL, so PERFECT, that it just didn't care about something as silly as "pressure"? Well, now you have exactly that! The Perfect Pump always runs at full speed, no matter how close to empty the input is. Multi-fluid providers will never be the same again!

So what price must be payed for this power? By default, the perfect pump is 3x2, compared to the 1x2 of regular pumps. They also consume significantly more power. Think of them like inserter cranes - you will usually only want to use them at train stations. There is a however a mod setting to make them the same size as normal pumps if you prefer.
